Protein 2° Structure analysis 1AO3 = A3 DOMAIN OF VON WILLEBRAND FACTOR 
# Human Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Structural and Predictive Analysis 🧬🔬

## Overview

This project provides a multi-tool analysis of the structure and secondary features of the **Human Von Willebrand Factor (vWF)**, a large glycoprotein crucial for hemostasis. The focus is on predicting and validating the 3D structure and secondary structure elements (SSEs) of a key functional domain (likely the vWF A-domain, based on PDB ID **1AO3** sequence).

The analysis utilizes established bioinformatics platforms to compare homology models and confirm secondary structure composition.

## Structural and Prediction Insights

### 1. Homology Modeling
* **SWISS-MODEL & Phyre2:** Both tools use the sequence from PDB ID **1AO3** (or a highly related sequence) to generate high-confidence 3D models. The structural domain is typically an $\alpha/\beta$ domain, characteristic of vWF's binding regions.

### 2. Secondary Structure Prediction (GOR4)
The GOR4 analysis provides a statistical breakdown of the secondary structure elements (SSEs) for the input sequence:

| SSE Type | Percentage | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha helix (Hh)** | **~35.29%** | Indicates a significant helical content. |
| **Extended strand (Ee)** | **~17.65%** | Indicates a notable $\beta$-sheet content. |
| **Random coil (Cc)** | **~47.06%** | Represents the remaining flexible loops and turns. |
*The presence of significant Alpha Helix and Extended Strand content confirms the mixed $\alpha/\beta$ fold of this protein domain.*
